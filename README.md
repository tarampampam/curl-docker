## Why this image created?

As you probably know, `curl` consists of two parts - the library with the same name and dynamically linked executable file. For using `curl` in docker images based on `scratch` (empty file system) we have two options:

- Put all required for `curl` libraries into the image
- Compile `curl` as a **static** binary

This repository contains dockerfile with the second way (the main idea was [looked here](https://github.com/moparisthebest/static-curl)).

> Important note: some `curl` features (lake `gopher`, `imap`, `proxy`, and others were disabled) for binary file size reasons.

Another important change is that when the `--fail` flag is used, the exit code is **1** _(instead of 22)_. You can read more details about the patch [here](patches/fail-exit-code.patch). This was made for use in docker healthcheck (the possible exit codes for docker healcheck are: 0 _(success, the container is healthy and ready for use)_ and 1 _(unhealthy - the container is not working correctly)_):

```bash
$ docker run --rm tarampampam/curl -s --fail --show-error https://httpbin.org/status/401
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 401
$ echo "Exit code: $?"
Exit code: 1
```

```

## How can I use this?

For example - as a docker healthcheck (note - we use `scratch` as a base):

```Dockerfile
# use empty filesystem
FROM scratch

# import some executable application
COPY --from=containous/whoami:v1.5.0 /whoami /whoami

# import curl from current repository image
COPY --from=tarampampam/curl:7.78.0 /bin/curl /bin/curl

# Docs: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck>
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=2s --retries=2 --start-period=2s CMD [ \
    "curl", "--fail", "http://127.0.0.1:80/" \
]

ENTRYPOINT ["/whoami"]
```

After that you can build this image, run, and watch the state:

```bash
$ docker build --tag healthcheck-test:local .
...
Successfully built 72bf22424af7
Successfully tagged healthcheck-test:local

$ docker run --rm -d --name healthcheck-test healthcheck-test:local
b3f20332ac19b42dfed03021c0b90b3650b9a7efbaea7c8800d35551e43d35d7

$ docker ps --filter 'name=healthcheck-test' --format '{{.Status}}'
Up 1 minutes (healthy)

$ docker kill healthcheck-test
```

## Releasing

New versions publishing is very simple - just make required changes in this repository, update the [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md) and "publish" new release using repo releases page.

Docker images will be build and published automatically.

> New release will overwrite the `latest` docker image tag in both registers.
